#Holberton Interview

This repository contains work on practice technical interview questions for Holberton School. Through these projects, I have gained a deeper understanding of data structures (linked lists, binary trees, AVL trees, etc.), sorting algorithms and better ways to refactor my code.

#These projects demonstrate work in a variety of languages, including:
C
python
javascript

Lamine Mokhatr Jemli:

Through my background in Engineering Physics, I have developed a passion for problem-solving and breaking down complex tasks. I have enjoyed solving these algorithm puzzles as I practice my skills for technical interviews and refine my understanding of more efficient algorithms and clean code.
